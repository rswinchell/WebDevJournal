Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?
// Being able to build a website and have a level of understanding and problem solving to figure out why things are the way they are
What about 6 months from now? // Beginning an entry level position as a software engineer - I need a career that can sustain me long term, that is flexible, stable, and can potentially be done remote
or 1 year from now? / Developing my skills to be able to be successful as a software engineer and as side project begin to help small businesses with their e-commerce websites on the side
Are you excited? Scared? Eager? // Nervous! This is my first exposure to coding and I am extremely unfamiliar with everything. 
What do you hope to accomplish? // Hoping to be able to grasp concepts well enough for an entry level position at the end of the program

Can you foresee potential roadblocks? // I had a hard time grasping concepts in the pre-work and think my non-existent experience with previous coding is putting me at the lowest beginner level possible.
What can be done to prevent or circumvent them? // Practice practice practice. Also having good outside videos or links to help review (I am looking for these myself).
Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success? Teach it to me like I'm 5! :) Going very slowly and walking through step by step is helpful.
